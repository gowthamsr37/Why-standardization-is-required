# Why-standardization-is-required
# Standardization or Z-Score Normalization is one of the feature scaling technique,it transforms features by subtracting from mean and dividing by standard deviation. This is often called as Z-score.
The resulting data will have the mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1
The scatter plots and distplots above shows that there will be no change in the distribution of data before and after applying the standard scaler, only the scale changes.
The accuracy of Logistic regression increased significantly after scaling.
But there was no effect on accuracy when the decision tree was used.
Outlier in the dataset will still remain as an outlier even after applying the standard scaling, we need to take care of the outlier by different methods.
